# Generate Image Gallery from Video File

## Summary
This is a simple React application that converts a video into an image gallery. 

This application allows the user to upload a video file. The video file is then broken up into 20 frames that are evenly distributed across the length of the video. Finally, the frames are visualized as individual images.
